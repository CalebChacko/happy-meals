Last year, my oven went on the fritz the night BEFORE Thanksgiving!  I had to rush to Walmart to get one of those shelftop electric cooker ovens in order to cook the bird.  I saw Tyler make this recipe and was determined to try it.  It turned out great and I will never cook a turkey any other way again!  The sage butter adds richness, the bacon adds a smoky flavor and the maple syrup (insist on genuine Vermont made) brings out a sweetness in the meat.  And all of that adds up to a wonderful maplely savory gravy!  Definately try this one...you'll love it.  I have a new oven now, but I'm still going to use that stovetop cooker!  There's no easier way to baste a bird!  Happy Thanksgiving!"", 'I ""Ditto"" the last review\'s comments. This is my 4th Maple Roasted Turkey with Sage, Smoked Bacon and Cornbread Stuffing.

A comment on the cook time for the potatoes, I diced them down to about approximately half inch long by quarter inch square pieces.

I am not to crazy about it myself. After last years attempt at him making a turkey we decided not to do turkey anymore, then I saw this and decided I would give it a shot for the first time all by myself. Let me say the turkey turned out moist and great. The thigh meat was falling off the bone. No more overcooked dry turkey. My husband kept telling our guests how great the Turkey tasted and how ""I did it up\' this year . But I did not do the bacon, I got scared and took the bacon off. It started smelling like bacon so I was skeptical about the turkey tasting like bacon. I did everything else exactly as stated and it was great . The turkey came out a golden brown. The stuffing was my favorite. It was the best stuffing ever.  I never liked stuffing beacuse I have only just has boxed stuffing, Never again ! The stuffing was so so tasty.   I will make this everytime I have to make stuffing .The gravy was a little sweet from the syrup, but once I added a packet of gravy mix in with the homemade gravy it evened out .  I also did the cranberry orange sauce that was a perfect compliment. This was a great recipe and it turned out perfect this Thanksgiving. I would do it again next year.', 'i made this for thanksgiving with rave reviews.  the turkey was juicy and sweet due to the basting and the cornbread stuffing was wonderful.  this is my thanksgiving turkey recipe from here on out.', 'I highly recommend this superb recipe.  It was delicious.', ""I found Tyler's recipe 3 years ago when making my first Thanksgiving, it is now requested every year.  The recipe is easy and uses all ingredience I love- Turkey (moist), cornbread, maple syrup and butter.  The only change I made is, I bought an injector and I actually inject the maple mixture into the meat of the turkey, it makes it so moist and flavorful.  Anyone I have ever had try the turkey asks for the recipe and never turns back."", ""WARNING: Making this recipe for family and friends at Thanksgiving will mean that you will be in charge of making the Turkey for every Thanksgiving for the REST OF YOUR LIFE!!! \n\nThis is the absolute best recipe for turkey I've every had!

You HAVE to try this one."", 'The turkey is moist with a ton of flavor; the stuffing is fantastic but the pan drippings were like burnt sugar from the syrup so the gravy was thrown out.

Thanks Tyler', '', 'I made my first Thanksgiving dinner from scratch and basically on my own this year. I used this recipe, and it turned out much better than I could have even hoped!

In fact, my family has been talking about this amazing diner all year! The maple/bacon drippings made the gravy dreams are made of, and although the recipe requires prep and attn, it is truly well worth it. Can't wait to do it again."", 'this is my third year making this recipe. it gets raves from guests! just awesome flavor, gravy to die for.', 'My very first turkey this Thanksgiving... it was very good and I plan on making it again next year!', ""I tend to use different recipes when I plan for my Thanksgiving dinner.  This year I used Tyler Florence's recipe for the Maple-Roasted Turkey with Sage and Smoked Bacon.  I also used Rachel Ray's Chipotle Gravy recipe and my family recipe for the stuffing.\nThe turkey was the absolute bomb; everyone loved it!  Turkey was juicy, tender, and very, very tasty.  The gravy was good too and had had a nice kick to it.\nThank you Food Network for sharing all your wonderful recipes!"", ""I didn't care for this. The gravy was too sweet. And the bacon was just odd.
