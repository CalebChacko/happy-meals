### Setting up the Python Virtual Environment
Start by running `pip install virtualenv`. If this is the first time creating a venv for the project run `python -m venv ./` inside of the project folder. This will create a new virtual environment where we can add packages. If done properly, you should now see multiple folders added to the project directory including `Scripts`

To run the environment, execute `.\Scripts\activate`.
